    "text='A recent Gallup poll revealed that 85% of workers worldwide are unhappy or downright miserable at their jobs. A study published in the International Journal of Advanced Research in 2019 found that parents exert a significant influence on their children’s career choices, especially in some cultures and parts of the world. Could there be a correlation? A cursory look at the issue can be revealing. Children tend to regard their parents as gods, capable of everything except error. This misconception eventually wanes, but the process can take years or even decades. But can parents really provide great career advice or direction, given their high authority in the eyes of their children? Most parents, studies show, never bother to uncover their children’s talents, strengths, and weaknesses. They generally either do not care about or fail to understand the importance of matching the child’s inborn potential with a career choice. '"

The players can advance to the baskets of the opposing team by running or dribbling. Every player is expected to behave in the proper conduct of sportsmanship, and any behaviour other than this attracts a penalty.  The game of basketball came in the year 1891, in Springfield, Massachusetts. Many other sports formed an inspiration for basketball. It has features of soccer and rugby. There are several positions in which players can play; there is a power forward, centre, small forward, point guard, and shooting guard. Each team comes up with a strategy called a trap, and the most common of all strategies are man-to-man defence. Several types of shots are tried by the players, like jump shot, set shot, lay-up and likewise. Slam dunk is another accurate shot.\n",
